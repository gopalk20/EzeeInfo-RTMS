# Pre-Implementation Checklist: RTMS Baseline

**Purpose**: Validate requirements completeness, constitution alignment, and implementation readiness before Phase 0  
**Created**: 2026-02-19  
**Feature**: [.specify/memory/spec.md](.specify/memory/spec.md) | **Plan**: [.specify/memory/plan.md](.specify/memory/plan.md)

**Note**: Generated by `/speckit.checklist` from spec, plan, and constitution.

## 1. Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK001 All eight principles (I–VIII) verified for alignment with implementation approach
- [ ] CHK002 BR-1 (daily hours limit) configurable via database or .env—no hard-coding
- [ ] CHK003 BR-2 (D+N policy) configurable—config keys for D and N
- [ ] CHK004 BR-3 (final approval locks entries) enforced at application and DB level
- [ ] CHK005 BR-4 (Rework %) calculated from formula—no manual override
- [ ] CHK006 BR-5 (Hourly Cost) calculated from formula—no manual override
- [ ] CHK007 Tech stack restricted to PHP 8.4, CodeIgniter 4, Smarty 5, MySQL—no additional frameworks
- [ ] CHK008 Audit trail planned for editable records (user, timestamp, before/after)

---

## 2. Requirements Completeness

- [ ] CHK009 All 4 roles (Employee, Product Lead, Manager, Finance) have defined Can Do / Cannot Do
- [ ] CHK010 Product Lead cannot approve—only Manager (FR-021)
- [ ] CHK011 Product Lead and Finance cannot see financial costing (FR-005)
- [ ] CHK012 GitHub sync scope: Issues + PRs (clarify Q1.5)
- [ ] CHK013 Branch linking: Employee selects from GitHub list; one branch per task (FR-011, Q1.4)
- [ ] CHK014 Status transitions: Webhooks for first commit → In Progress, merge → Completed (FR-013, FR-014)
- [ ] CHK015 D+N policy edit guard implemented (FR-017)
- [ ] CHK016 Rework: Employee marks is_rework when logging (FR-019)
- [ ] CHK017 Timeline exceeded: Show warning; allow logging (FR-020a, Q6.2)
- [ ] CHK018 Employee removed: Reassign tasks to Product Lead (Q6.3)
- [ ] CHK019 Max time exceeded: Warn only; do not block (Q2.1)

---

## 3. Phase 0 Readiness

- [ ] CHK020 PHP 8.4, CodeIgniter 4, MySQL 8.x verified
- [ ] CHK021 Extensions: pdo_mysql, curl, json, mbstring available
- [ ] CHK022 Existing users table can be extended with role_id
- [ ] CHK023 roles table migration designed (Employee, Product Lead, Manager, Finance)
- [ ] CHK024 config table migration designed (daily_hours_limit, D, N, working_days, standard_hours)
- [ ] CHK025 RoleFilter design documented; route-role mapping defined
- [ ] CHK026 Auth: session-based, CSRF, bcrypt/argon2 (existing or to implement)

---

## 4. Phase 1–6 Prerequisites

- [x] CHK027 Products schema: name, start_date, end_date, max_allowed_hours, github_repo_url
- [x] CHK028 product_members join table designed
- [ ] CHK029 GitHub PAT or App token strategy defined (storage, rotation)
- [ ] CHK030 Webhook endpoint URL strategy (public URL or ngrok for dev)
- [x] CHK031 time_entries schema includes is_rework flag
- [ ] CHK032 approvals table designed (task_id, approver_id, approved_at, status)
- [ ] CHK033 Export libraries for CSV, PDF, Excel identified

---

## 5. Security & RBAC

- [ ] CHK034 Every controller action has role check before business logic
- [ ] CHK035 No client-side-only enforcement of permissions
- [ ] CHK036 Manager-only routes: approve, user/role management, costing
- [ ] CHK037 Product Lead blocked from approve and costing routes
- [ ] CHK038 Employee blocked from create product/task, assign, approve
- [ ] CHK039 Finance blocked from create/modify products/tasks, approve

---

## 6. Data Integrity & Edge Cases

- [ ] CHK040 Locked entries (approved) cannot be modified—guard in controller/model
- [ ] CHK041 Branch already linked: Reject link if branch used by another task
- [ ] CHK042 GitHub sync failure: Disable sync, log error, surface to admin
- [ ] CHK043 Rejection flow: Return to previous state; log feedback (Constitution V)

---

## 7. Testing & Traceability

- [ ] CHK044 Critical paths identified for automated tests: timesheet validation, approval, costing
- [ ] CHK045 Migration rollback path documented
- [ ] CHK046 Feature work traceable to FR IDs in spec

---

## 8. User Story Acceptance

- [ ] CHK047 US1: Product Lead creates product, adds members, links repo—acceptance scenarios testable
- [ ] CHK048 US2: Employee links branch, logs time, completes task—status reflects Git activity
- [ ] CHK049 US3: Manager approves—task locked; Product Lead/Employee cannot approve
- [ ] CHK050 US4: Finance views reports; export CSV/PDF/Excel
- [ ] CHK051 US5: Employee logs rework time; Rework % calculated correctly

---

## 9. Success Criteria Alignment

- [ ] CHK052 SC-001: Product Lead create product + add members + link repo in &lt;5 min
- [ ] CHK053 SC-002: Employee task flow with Git-backed status transitions
- [ ] CHK054 SC-003: Finance generates task-wise and employee-wise reports
- [ ] CHK055 SC-004: 100% RBAC enforcement (no role bypass)
- [ ] CHK056 SC-005: BR-3 enforced—completed/approved timing immutable
- [ ] CHK057 SC-006: Rework % correct per BR-4

## Notes

- Mark items complete with `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline as needed
- Link to spec FR, plan phase, or constitution section
